Pretty straight forward given that the "wrap-around" of the movements can be easily modeled using the modulo operator.
This is in $O(1)$ neglecting any input reading.


## Part 2
First time I see such a AoC problem type. Very unstructured and suprising but refreshing and fun. My approach was to find put if any interessting (aka. big) connected components of robots. This is based on an assumption that the "drawing" of the 
christmas tree is a sufficiently large and connected one. My threshold, because why not, was set to 42. After waiting less time than I thought (since it is still a kind of brute forcy solution) the tree appreared.
