# Advent of Code 2024

This year, in order to prepare for an upcoming NG software engineering position, I want to brush up my C++ skills. 

The focus lies in using modern C++ best practices and getting used to implementing efficient and correct solutions to this year's AoC challenges.

Topics I would like to dive into at some point - without wanting to restrict myself to doing so - are:

1) Generic template (meta-)programming
2) SOTA library and standard usage like eigen or mpi
3) Cache-, copy-, compiletime- and syscall-optimized solutions
4) New c++20 and c++23 approaches like using concepts, coroutines or pattern matching
5) ...

Since the main goal will be to solve the challenges in fun ways and getting a deeper understanding of c++ (and because I will only start to work in february) I will not try to optimize for solving speed and there might even be some backlog occuring because of other private ventures.

However, I will try to create a write up for each solution explaining my approach and the idea behind it.

| Day | Challenge | Runtime  | Approach keywords    |
|-----|-----------|----------|----------------------|
| 1   | TBD       | TBD      | TBD                  |
| 2   | TBD       | TBD      | TBD                  |
| 3   | TBD       | TBD      | TBD                  |
